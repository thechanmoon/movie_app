        Love gives you wings. It makes you fly. I don't even call it love. 
        I call it Geronimo. When you're in love, you'll jump right from the 
        top of the Empire State and you won't care, screaming "Geronimo" the whole way 
        down. I love her so bad, I just... whoa, she wrecks me. I'd die for her.
